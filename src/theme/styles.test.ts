// makeStyles(scheme) is called on every render (see src/screens/DivesScreen.tsx). If it built a
// fresh StyleSheet each time, `styles` would get a new object identity on every render,
// defeating React.memo on any component that receives it as a prop — invisible with two
// screens, a real cost once a FlashList of dive rows depends on it. The sheets must be
// built once per scheme and handed back by reference, so this pins reference equality,
// not just deep equality (two different objects with the same shape would still fail
// React.memo's shallow prop comparison).
